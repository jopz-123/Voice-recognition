# Voice-recognition

Speech recognition is an interdisciplinary subfield of computer science and computational linguistics that develops methodologies and 
technologies that enable the recognition and translation of spoken language into text by computers with the main benefit of searchability.
It is also known as automatic speech recognition (ASR), computer speech recognition or speech to text (STT).
It incorporates knowledge and research in the computer science, linguistics and computer engineering fields. The reverse process is speech synthesis.
When artificial intelligence (AI) evolved, it touched almost all facets of life and surroundings. 
Speech recognition is one such technology that is empowered by AI to add convenience to its users. 
This new technology has the power to convert voice messages to text. And it also has the ability to recognize an individual based on their voice command. 
Hence, this AI-powered speech recognition technology gained mammoth importance among tech giants such as Apple, Microsoft, Amazon, Google, Facebook, etc.
Amazon Echo, Siri and Google Home are some of the apps and devices that flooded the market with speech recognition features.
